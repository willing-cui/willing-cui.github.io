<p style="text-align: justify;">
    My academic path has been guided by a genuine curiosity and a humble desire to contribute meaningfully to the fields of information engineering and emerging technologies. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in <strong>Information Engineering</strong> at <strong></str><a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a> (ranked 32nd in QS)</strong>, under the supervision of <strong>Professor Soung Chang LIEW</strong>. My research explores areas such as <strong>optical wireless communication</strong>, <strong>routing algorithms</strong>, <strong>LLM-based AI agents</strong>, <strong>IoT systems</strong>, and <strong>AI-powered wireless communication</strong> — topics I find both intellectually challenging and deeply inspiring, and to which I hope to offer modest contributions through dedicated <a href="#work">work</a>.

    Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Bachelor's degree in <strong>Electronic Information Engineering</strong> at <strong>Shandong University</strong>, one of China's top universities. Through a competitive selection process, I was admitted to <strong>Chongxin College</strong>, an honors program within the department that offered an enriched curriculum and rigorous laboratory training. There, I devoted myself to my studies and achieved a <strong>GPA of 4.625/5.0</strong>, ranking <strong>1st</strong> in my cohort. This experience not only provided me with a solid foundation in engineering principles but also taught me the value of perseverance and lifelong learning.
