<p style="text-align: justify;">
    My academic journey has been shaped by a deep curiosity and a desire to contribute meaningfully to
    the fields of information engineering and emerging technologies. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in
    <strong>Information Engineering</strong> at 
    <strong></str><a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a> (36th in QS)</strong>, 
    under the supervision of <strong>Professor Soung Chang LIEW</strong>. My research explores areas such as 
    <strong>optical wireless communication</strong>, <strong>routing algorithms</strong>, <strong>LLM-based AI agents</strong>, 
    and <strong>AI-powered wireless communication</strong> and <strong>IoT systems</strong> —
    topics I find both challenging and inspiring, and to which I aim to
    contribute through <a href="#work">my work</a>.

    Before embarking on my Ph.D., I earned my Bachelor’s degree in <strong>Electronic Information
        Engineering</strong> at
    <strong>Shandong University</strong>, one of China’s top universities. Through a competitive
    selection process, I was
    admitted to <strong>Chongxin College</strong>, an advanced program within the department that
    offered a broader
    curriculum and rigorous experimental requirements. There, I worked diligently to achieve a
    <strong>GPA of
        4.625/5.0</strong>, ranking <strong>1st</strong> in my class. This experience not only
    provided me with a solid foundation
    in engineering principles but also taught me the value of perseverance and continuous learning.
